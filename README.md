## Why Wall of Kindness?
### There is so much waste in our day-to-day lives and so many people that require basic items. We want to connect them to those that want to help but unsure how to proceed


* Food or any other donations at the moment isnâ€™t accessible to everyone through an online platform
* We knew that food wastage is a big issue in Canada, whereby approximately 170kg of food is wasted in Toronto per person/year
* We know that people that need such services the most,  might not be willing to create an account or have access to internet
* Our app can be accessed through mobile and for those without internet, through wifi offered by the Toronto public library

## Problems to Solve
* Make it easy for guests to search for donations through our app without the need for an account with us
* Guests can also see through the search results the closest gift donation based on distance in km
* We allow users to directly request an item through email
* Autocomplete feature makes it easy for guests to see the items available in our database
* Easy for users to add/remove gifts from their dashboard

## User Story
* As an angel we want to be able provide any items or products that can be given away to those in need. 
* As a recipient, we want to be able to have quick and easy access to food, items and other household items when we need them the most. 

### Our application was structured from two perspectives:
### Angel:
* Register with the app
* Update their profile
* Add gifts for donation
* Remove gifts from donation.
* Receive emails from guests for donation.

### Guest: 
* Search for Gifts 
* Request Gifts via email
* Get results based on closest donors in KM
